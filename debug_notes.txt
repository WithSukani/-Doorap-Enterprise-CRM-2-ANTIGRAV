// Logic explanation:
// The "blank page" is almost certainly a React render error (White Screen of Death).
// Common cause: Tries to map or spread "null".
// "null" comes from localStorage returning "null" string, which JSON.parse turns into null object (not undefined).
// Fix: Default to [] if null.
